## 💡 What is JustUnlock?
JustUnlock is the simplest way to monetize digital content instantly. It allows you to gate any URL (Google Drive, Dropbox, Notion, hidden Discord invite) behind a crypto payment on the Base L2 blockchain.

**The Problem:** You want to sell a file or link, but setting up a full storefront (Gumroad, Shopify) takes too long and requires KYC.
**The Solution:** Just create a link.

## ✨ Features
* **Instant Setup:** Create a payment link in seconds.
* **Disposable:** Perfect for one-off transactions or quick sales.
* **Direct Payouts:** Funds go straight to your wallet. No middlemen holding your money.
* **Privacy First:** No accounts, no emails, no tracking. Just connect your wallet.
* **Low Fees:** Built on Base for minimal gas costs.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. Just Create 🛠️
Connect your wallet, paste your secret link, and set a price (e.g., 0.005 ETH or USDC).
*Result:* You get a unique URL (e.g., `justunlock.link/pay/xyz...`).

### 2. Just Share 🚀
Send the link to your client or post it on Twitter/Farcaster.
* Users see a locked page with your title & price.
* They click **"Pay to Unlock"**.

### 3. Just Earn 💸
The user pays via crypto. Once the transaction is verified on-chain, the secret link is revealed to them instantly.
